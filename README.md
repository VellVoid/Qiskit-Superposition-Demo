# 🌐 Basic Quantum Circuit with Qiskit

This repository contains a simple Python script that uses the Qiskit library to create a quantum circuit. The circuit prepares a single qubit in a superposition state, measures it, and then prints the counts of the measurement results.

## 📝 Description

The quantum circuit is executed on Qiskit's Quantum Assembly Language (QASM) simulator. The measurement is repeated 1000 times to highlight the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. The counts of the measurement results (i.e., how many times the qubit was found in state 0 and how many times it was found in state 1) are printed to the console.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📚 Dependencies

* Python 3.6 or later.
* Qiskit. You can install it using pip: `pip install qiskit`.

### ▶️ Executing program

* Run the script with Python: `python quantum_circuit.py`.
